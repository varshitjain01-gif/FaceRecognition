# Face Recognizer Using OpenCV

## Description

This project is a simple face recognition system built using Python and OpenCV. The system can detect and recognize human faces in real-time using a webcam. It can be used as a basic building block for more complex applications like security systems, attendance monitoring, or personal projects involving face recognition.

## Features

Real-time face detection using OpenCV

Simple and easy-to-understand codebase
Uses Haar cascades for face detection
Easily extendable and customizable

## Usage

1. Prepare the Dataset
2. Train the Model
3. Run Face Recognition
4.
